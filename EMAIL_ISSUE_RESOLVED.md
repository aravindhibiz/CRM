# 🎉 Email Function Issue RESOLVED!

## ✅ Root Cause Found & Fixed

The issue was **missing authorization headers** in the frontend requests to Supabase Edge Functions.

### What Was Wrong:
- Supabase Edge Functions require an `Authorization: Bearer <anon_key>` header
- Your frontend was only sending `Content-Type: application/json`
- This caused **401 Unauthorized** errors

### What We Fixed:
1. **Added Authorization Header** to `src/services/emailService.js`
2. **Updated Secrets** in Supabase with your API keys
3. **Redeployed Function** with latest code

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Frontend Fix (`src/services/emailService.js`):
```javascript
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${SUPABASE_ANON_KEY}`, // ✅ ADDED THIS
}
```

### Secrets Updated:
- ✅ RESEND_API_KEY: Set with your key
- ✅ GEMINI_API_KEY: Set and working
- ✅ Function: Redeployed successfully

## 📧 How Email Now Works:

1. **Frontend** → Sends request with proper auth headers
2. **Supabase Edge Function** → Accepts request (no more 401!)
3. **Gemini AI** → Enhances email content 
4. **Resend API** → Delivers email to `aravindprime23@gmail.com` (testing mode)

## 🧪 Test Your Email Function:

1. **From CRM**: Go to contact management → Send email
2. **Expected Result**: Email sent successfully to your Gmail
3. **Enhanced Content**: Should see AI-improved email content

## 📝 Important Notes:
